"""
pose_interpolator.py — SLAM pose history interpolator.

Maintains a rolling buffer of timestamped 4×4 drone body poses published
by Point-LIO on /aft_mapped_to_init and returns the interpolated pose at
any requested timestamp.

Interpolation method
--------------------
  Translation : Linear (LERP).  Translation error from linear interpolation
                is negligible at the pose rates produced by Point-LIO
                (≥ 10 Hz) and the camera trigger intervals used in this
                project (0.5–2 Hz).

  Rotation    : Spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) via
                scipy.spatial.transform.Slerp.  SLERP is used instead of
                naïve matrix interpolation because linearly blending
                rotation matrices does not produce valid rotation matrices
                (their determinant deviates from 1.0 and they are no longer
                orthogonal at intermediate steps), which would introduce
                geometric distortion in the projected texture.

Extrapolation
-------------
  The interpolator allows extrapolation up to EXTRAPOLATION_LIMIT_NS
  (50 ms) beyond the last received pose.  This accommodates software-timed
  camera captures whose timestamps may lag slightly behind the last SLAM
  message.  Extrapolation beyond this limit returns None to prevent bad
  projections from stale data.

Thread safety
-------------
  add_pose() and get_pose_at() both acquire a threading.Lock so the
  interpolator can be called from a ROS callback thread (add_pose) and
  the main processing thread (get_pose_at) concurrently without data races.

Dependencies
------------
  numpy, scipy  — available in the dronepi conda environment.
  No ROS dependency — the class works identically in offline bag replay
  and in standalone unit tests.

    Parameters
    ----------
    max_history : int
        Maximum number of poses to retain.  Older poses are discarded

        which is physically correct for a rigid body moving between
